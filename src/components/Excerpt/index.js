      Just this once
      <br /> Let me peel back this thin veneer of coping
      <br /> and show you where it hurts
      <br /> Which wounds healed, and the lessons they taught
      <br /> Show me that I am not alone
      <br /> Hold me safe in your listening
      <br /> Sans judgement and prejudice
      <br />
      <br /> Let my words spill out of a jaw
      <br /> once held tight
      <br /> Not like a dam overflowing
      <br /> but a restless river with a story to tell
      <br /> I have stories to tell
      <br /> I have stories worth telling
